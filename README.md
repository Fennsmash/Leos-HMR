# Holistic Model of Reality — HMR-MATH Framework

## Overview
The **Holistic Model of Reality (HMR)** — Mathematics Division — establishes the formal structure for the theory of consciousness and physical law proposed by Michael Leonidas Emerson. The **HMR-MATH** framework defines the logical, quantitative, and symbolic system that connects information, awareness, and natural order under one mathematical model.

This repository serves as the mathematical foundation of the broader HMR research corpus, from which the physical, biological, and philosophical layers are derived. Each paper is written in Overleaf-ready LaTeX format, following a consistent academic cadence:

**Abstract → Introduction → Axioms and Framework → Theorems → Consequences → Discussion → References → Conclusion**

## Purpose
The goal of HMR-MATH is to establish a complete and internally consistent mathematical architecture that:
- Describes consciousness and intelligence as finite information systems.
- Demonstrates how information structure can yield physical and experiential phenomena.
- Provides a testable and constructive bridge between formal logic, physics, and biology.
- Supplies a reproducible foundation for the broader HMR framework.

## Contents
- Formal mathematical papers (HMR-MATH-01 through HMR-MATH-15)
- Supporting derivations, definitions, and tables (including the Telly Table)
- Proof structures and diagrams explaining the relationship between information, perception, and emergence
- Reference cross-links to ongoing synthesis work in the Holistic Model of Reality series
